    "meta_analysis": "Combee in the meta PvE Analysis Combee has an ATK stats of only 59, giving it negligible DPS. Moreover, Bug is a poor offensive typing unless the said Pokémon’s stats are high. With such a weak profile, Combee is not meant for PvE battles like Raids or Gyms. PvP Analysis 🧸 Little Cup Despite having only one Fast Move and one Charged Move, Combee is viable in the Little Cup thanks to wins against some premier threats like Deino, Wynaut, Bulbasaur, Umbreon, Wooper, Barboach, Shelmet, and Chansey. It helps that Combee’s stats lean towards DEF and HP. 👍 However, even though Combee bags some notable wins, it's still not a reliable Pokémon overall due to the limited coverage of Bug-type offense. 🪲 Combee is too weak for any other PvP League. 💎 The best PvP moves for Combee are Bug Bite and Bug Buzz.",
