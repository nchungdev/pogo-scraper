It copies the moveset of the species it photobombs, making it the Pokémon with the most diverse movepool in the game. However, even with the best moves, it’s useless due to its mere 40 Attack stat and 83 Defense (the 146 Stamina doesn’t make any difference). 🫣🫣🫣 This Pokémon is just a collectible . PvP Analysis With hideous stats , Smeargle is just terrible in PvP . Since it maxes out at 487 CP , it can be a fun wildcard in the Little Cup with an unexpected moveset , but that’s the only redeeming quality it has in PvP. The rest is completely pointless. 😝",
