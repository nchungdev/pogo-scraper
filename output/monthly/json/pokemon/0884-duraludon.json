    "meta_analysis": "Duraludon in the meta PvE Analysis Duraludon is a Steel/Dragon-type Pokémon with a decent ATK stat, low bulk, and a bad attack set. With better Charged Attacks, it could have made somewhat of an impact but with its current attack set, it just fades into obscurity in the meta. ⚔️ Raids Forget titans like Mega Rayquaza and Eternatus (Dragon), Crowned forms of Zacian and Galarian (Steel), Shadows, or even Megas, both Steel and Dragon consist of powerful Pseudo Legendaries that Duraludon can't compete with, even with a stronger attack set. 🛡️ Gyms Even with 10 type resistances, Duraludon’s isn't too bulky. Moreover, it's weak to the common Fighting-type Gym attackers, so there's that. 👎 🔮 Dynamax Pokémon Dynamax Duraludon is no top-tier DMax Pokémon but it's definitely not bad by any means. Access to the coveted 0.5s Fast Attack in Metal Claw and the Steel subtyping makes it a worthwhile tank, especially when it taps into those resistances. Till Gigantamax Duraludon comes into play, Dynamax Duraludon is a budget Steel type tank that can go alongside the Crowned forms of Zacian and Zamazenta if you're lacking a Dynamax Metagross. 💎 The best PvE attacks for Duraludon are Dragon Tail and Dragon Claw (Raids and Gyms) and Metal Claw and (anything) for Max Battles. Show more Show less PvP Analysis 🔵 Great League Duraludon can function as a decent safe switch into types that it resists, but it is quite bad on an offensive role, grabbing very few wins. Additionally, its ATK oriented stats make it a poor fit for the Great League’s CP restrictions. It's extremely challenging to give Duraludon a spot in your Great League team. 🟡 Ultra League Again, the League’s CP gap is harsh on Duraludon, making it awkward to use in battle. Not to mention, there's a legion of better Steel and Dragon types in this format that do get the job done more successfully. 🟣 Master League Duraludon would have been stronger in battle had it debuted in an earlier generation, but alas, it is severely outclassed by a large number of Pokémon in the Master League. Tragically, two top-notch Master League threats share the same Steel/Dragon typing, making Duraludon a forgotten mess. Even on its own, Duraludon achieves virtually nothing in the Master League, especially after Dragon Tail’s damage nerf, and underwhelming attacks in general. 💎 The best PvP attacks for Duraludon are Dragon Tail, Dragon Claw and Flash Cannon.
