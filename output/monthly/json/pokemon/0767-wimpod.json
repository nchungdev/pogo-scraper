    "meta_analysis": "Wimpod in the meta PvE Analysis Bug types generally aren't a big deal in PvE , and poor little Wimpod has terrible stats (none of them cross 100) that are meant to keep it far, far away from raids and gyms . 😅 PvP Analysis 🧸 Little Cup Wimpod is weak in the Little Cup , its low stats doing it zero favors. But fun fact, Wimpod beats Deino , Wynaut , and Seel , three of the best Little Cup Pokémon. Sadly, those few wins don't cement Wimpod as a usable part of this meta. 🥲 💥 The best moves for Wimpod in the Little Cup are Struggle Bug and Bug Buzz . Wimpod’s highest CP is just 567 , so any other PvP platform is out of bounds.",
