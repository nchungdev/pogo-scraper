    "meta_analysis": "Tynamo in the meta PvE Analysis ⚔️ Raids Tynamo is a big no to bring into Raid battles , even if you were up against a Wingull with a double weakness to Electric ! Being a base form, it hasn't built up enough charge to make any impact in raids. Its moveset doesn't even include a Charged Electric attack ! 🛡️ Gyms Other than the comical benefit of being so small it would hide behind other defenders, and even though it's weak only to Ground moves , Tynamo has no staying power in gyms . PvP Analysis 🧸 Little League The lack of a good moveset is just one of its problems for PVP usage , with Struggle being its only option for a charged move. Pair that with the typical base form stat spread, and you should be looking for another Electric type Pokémon to use. 🔵 Great League As per the Little League , no good moves make it a bad battler already, but Tynamo also maxes out at 917 CP , far below the 1500 CP cap that other Pokémon would be battling at. 🟡 Ultra League He's just a little Electric eel , why would you do this to him? 🟣 Master League He already fainted before we typed this.",
