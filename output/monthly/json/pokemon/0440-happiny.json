Carry it in your arms and don't even think about sending it to Raids ! 😄 🛡️ Gyms Well, you can build a Baby Pokémon themed Gym and put Happiny there. Many players don't attack such Gyms for 8 hours at least, so you can expect to grab your daily 50 PokéCoins because cuteness is the ultimate defense ! 😉 Also, the 225 HP doesn't help much when the Defense is so low. 😬 PvP Analysis 🧸 Little Cup Despite its phenomenal 225 HP , Happiny’s Attack and Defense are terrible. Moreover, it has a poor moveset .
